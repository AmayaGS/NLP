We will therefore concentrate on adding as features whether the review was made after a *Verified Purchase*. We will also add the review length and finally, although we have seen there is a balanced number of fake and real reviews for the different ratings, we will also add *Rating* as a category - as one would intuitively expect there might be a difference between reviews based on their ratings if they are real or fake.

    "We can see from the combination of vectors that the feature which most contributes to the increasing testing accuracy is *Verified purchase*, which increases our Precision score from 0.63 to to 0.82 - a nearly 20 points improvement reached by only adding one feature. Clearly this feature is given a lot of importance when the specialists at amazon manually curate the reviews and decide which are real and which are fake. Regarding other features, review length alone only gave us an increase of 1 point in overall accuracy, whilst rating alone actually resulted in decrease accuracy. The combination of these three features gave a very marginal improvement in accuracy compared to using *Verified purchase* alone - reaching scores of **Precision: 0.823, Recall: 0.818, F-Score:0.818**. \n",
