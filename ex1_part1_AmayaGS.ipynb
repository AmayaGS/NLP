    "The aim of this assignment is to classify a corpus of 21 000 Amazon reviews, equally distributed between \"real\" or \"fake\" reviews. where fake is defined as being reviews written for a product with the intent of receiving financial compensation for doing so. The reviews have been previously analysed and manually labelled by the company itself. The corpus also contains information regarding each reviews: rating, verified purchase, product category, product ID, product title, review title.\n",

    "The very first task for an NLP task is to preprocess the input text in such a way as to make it usable for the machine learning algorithm of our choice. To do so one must first load the data (*cf.* **loadData** function), in this case a tab delimitated text file, with utf8 coding. The data is loaded review by review, with all the features associated to said review kept in a list. The **parseReview** function then accepts as input each review (also indicated as *line*) and keep only the review ID as an integer, labels as real or fake and review text as string, passes the label names to real or fake, as well as passing the review ID from string to integer. Each element of the list is then assigned to a separate variable: *Id*, *Text* and *Label* and returned by **parseReview** within **loadData**. Each triple so returned is then appended to the *rawData* variable and kept. "

    "Now that our data is organised as a dictionary of token frequencies for each review, we can use it to train our Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the training set. We must first define the **crossValidate** function which will take our training data and successively split it into a training and a hold out set. The size of the hold out set will depend on the number of folds we wish to divide our data into and is a parameter of the function. The cross validation will then loop over the data creating a foldsize split for the test data, which moves across the data length and a training set composed of all the data except the hold out set. The classifier is training on the training set and then its predictive abilities tested on the hold out set - measuring precision, recall and fscore. We therefore retrain our classifier for each different split and obtain different accuracy results on the testing set: the accuracy results are then presented as the average of the results obtained in each split."
